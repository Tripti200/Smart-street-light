/************************ SMART STREET LIGHT *******************************
 *  *****************************************************************************
 * 
 * This is a open source project made by TRIPTI LOHANI 
 * 
 * The SMART STREET LIGHT project is a advanced street light which consumes less power than traditional street light as it detects the presence of any pedestrian or vehicle on the road which 
 * triggers the lamps to turn on at full brightness and stays on for some time and dims automatically after some time. The motivation behind the project came from the fact that traditional 
 * halogen street lights consume far more power as comapred to the SMART STREET LIGHT and they dont dim and consume very high energy and gets damaed easily. In this time I saw many street 
 * lights just stay damaged for countless years because they have a very short lifespan as comared to LED lights so our project will last longer and consume far more less energy than traditional 
 * street lights.
